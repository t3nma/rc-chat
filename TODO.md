### Questions

* who should escape messages with multiple '////' when the user is in a room? The user|server|nevermid ?
* should commands like "/bye ola ola2" be handled like "/bye" ?
* usar system.exit(0) para sair do cliente ?
* does the message sender also receives the message (inside a room?)
* ISO-8859-1 ???
