### Questions

* Client send raw messsages, Server concers about escaping, right?
* escape happens when the message starts with a minimum of two '/', right?
* should commands like "/bye ola ola2" be handled like "/bye" ?
* can we user System.exit(0) to exit the client on close ?
* does the message sender also receives the message (inside a room?)
* ISO-8859-1 ???
